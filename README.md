# CYBER-COUNTER

**This WebExtension counts CYBERS! Every cyber counts!

## How to use it:

Download this git-repo into some folder. Go to the page about:debugging and click on "Load Temporary Add-On". Navigate into the folder with this repo and double click on the manifest.json file.

The Extension will then open an alert summing up the total amount of cybers on the website you're visiting!

## Ideas for the future:

- Open a popup when CYBERS are found in a website and display the amount, maybe even a scale with a ratio cyber-to-non-cyber
- Alternatively, add button that has an overlay showing the number of cybers in a [badgeText].
- Make this an actual WebExtension, downloadable via about:addons

## Contribution:

Is extremely welcome! Please make cyber nicer! <3
